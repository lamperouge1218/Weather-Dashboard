# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

This app was designed to be a weather predictor, showing the daily forecast for a given city including Temperature, Wind Speed, Humidity, and UV Index (with color indicator showing the UV Zone). The app also shows a 5-day forecast for that given city.

## Usage

This app functions simply, using text entry of a city to provide a detailed weather forecast for that day as well as a 5-day forecast. The 5-day forecast shows Temp, Wind, and Humidity as a prediction for the selected city. Icons indicating the weather forecast also appear beside the 5-day forecast items.
